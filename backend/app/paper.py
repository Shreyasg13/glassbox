"""Paper-trading + backtest engine.

Turns the quant engine's BUY/SELL/HOLD signals into simulated portfolios so
the strategy can be measured, compared and improved. No database and no
network in here -- accounts are plain dicts and prices come from a PriceBook,
so the same code drives the historical replay ("backtest") and the daily live
cycle, and can be tested exhaustively. Persistence and scheduling live in
app/scripts/run_paper_cycle.py; the admin API is routers/paper.py.

RULES (deliberately simple, all stated so results can be audited):

* Decisions use day D's close; orders EXECUTE at day D+1's close. Signals at D
  use D's close, so filling at D's close would be a look-ahead. Fractional
  shares, long-only, no leverage, no shorting.
* Costs: COMMISSION_BPS (default 5 bps) of every traded notional.
* engine_tilt: target weight of a symbol = invested * strategic_weight * tilt,
  where tilt is the engine's own suggested-weight multiplier (BUY 1.5x, HOLD
  1.0x, SELL 0.5x -- the same numbers /api/live-signals reports). Total above
  100% is scaled down; anything left over is cash, so SELL signals raise cash
  (risk-off) and BUY signals deploy it. A position is capped at the risk
  policy's max_position unless the strategic weight itself is larger.
  Trading is event-driven, not every-wiggle: an account rebalances when its
  signal set changes, or every REBALANCE_DAYS trading days if any weight has
  drifted more than DRIFT_THRESHOLD from target.
* static_rebalanced: the same strategic weights and the SAME rebalancing rules
  but every signal treated as HOLD. Every profile gets one as its benchmark
  ("policy portfolio"), so alpha = what the signals added, net of costs,
  rather than being muddied by rebalancing-vs-buy-and-hold effects.
* static_hold: buy the weights once and never trade (SPY / equal-weight
  controls).
* random_tilt: a placebo. Each symbol is driven by a DIFFERENT symbol's real
  signal history (a seeded cyclic shift), so signal frequency and persistence
  are exactly the engine's but any relationship to the symbol's own price is
  destroyed. If the engine cannot beat this, its signals carry no information.
* Every trading day is tagged "backtest" (before the account's live_from date)
  or "live". Backtest results are IN-SAMPLE: the trained parameters
  (RSI thresholds, MA windows) were fitted on this same history, so backtest
  returns are optimistic. Live results are genuine out-of-sample paper trading.
* committee_tilt: engine_tilt, except that a symbol the Investment Committee reviewed
  in the last COMMITTEE_MAX_AGE_DAYS trading days is tilted by the committee's
  risk-gated action instead of the raw engine signal. Same universe and rules as the
  "engine on all symbols" control, so the difference between the two is exactly what
  the committee added. It only differs from the engine on live days (there is no
  committee history to replay).
* Tax lens (an ESTIMATE, not advice): every buy opens a FIFO lot and every sell closes
  lots, splitting realised gains into short-term (held 365 days or less) and long-term.
  est_tax applies PAPER_TAX_ST / PAPER_TAX_LT (assumed 32% / 15%) to the net gains, so
  the leaderboard can show what an active strategy keeps AFTER tax versus buy-and-hold,
  where the gain stays unrealised and untaxed.
* Wash sales (taxable accounts): a loss realised on a symbol that was also bought in the 30
  days before or after is DISALLOWED and added to the replacement shares' cost basis, so a
  strategy that sells at a loss and rebuys soon after cannot bank the loss. (Simplified: symbol
  level, holding period of the replacement is not tacked on.)
* tax_status: "taxable" (the default; the tax lens above applies) or "sheltered" (IRA / 401k /
  Roth-style: no tax on realised gains and no wash-sale rule, trading costs only). Both wrappers
  are tracked as separate accounts so the same strategy can be compared in each.
* engine_taxaware (for the taxable wrapper): the engine, minus what makes it expensive after tax.
    - Lot selection: sells losses first, then long-term gains, and short-term gains last.
    - Short-term gain lock: a lot held a year or less at a gain is NOT sold unless that
      symbol's risk regime is HIGH (then protecting the gain wins over the tax).
    - Signals must persist TA_DEBOUNCE_DAYS trading days before they are acted on.
    - Wider rebalance bands (TA_DRIFT_THRESHOLD / TA_REBALANCE_DAYS / TA_MIN_TRADE_FRACTION).
    - A BUY into a HIGH-risk regime is held at HOLD.
  The pre-tax return can be lower than the plain engine's; what matters is the return AFTER tax.
* external_tilt (the arena): trades the tilts (BUY 1.5x, HOLD 1.0x, SELL 0.5x) of an OUTSIDE challenger's recorded
  daily calls, e.g. another multi-agent framework, on the same universe and rules as "engine on all symbols". A symbol
  the challenger gave no fresh call on is NEUTRAL (HOLD), never quietly backed by our own engine, so the result is the
  challenger's and nothing else.
* trend_filter (Faber-style, no engine signals): a symbol is held at its strategic weight only while its
  close at the END OF THE PREVIOUS MONTH was above its 200-day average; otherwise that slice sits in cash.
  The state changes at most once a month and uses only past data, so it neither peeks nor churns.
* vol_target (risk-managed sizing, no engine signals): the strategic basket is held in full when its trailing
  VOL_WINDOW-day volatility is at or below VOL_TARGET, and scaled by VOL_TARGET / volatility above that,
  rounded to VOL_STEP (10%) steps so it only trades on a real change in regime. Never above 100%: no leverage.
  Both were specified in advance from their standard textbook forms (200 days, 15% / 60 days) and are NOT
  tuned to this history; they are judged like every other strategy, by their result after tax.
