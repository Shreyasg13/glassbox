# GlassBox — Project Status & Task Tracker

Living document. Update this whenever a phase completes, a bug is found,
or scope changes — this is the single place to check "where are we" and
"what's next" without re-deriving it from chat history.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-11 (Phase 14 + voice-cache fix)

## Live deployment

| | |
|---|---|
| App | https://glassbox-portfolio-review.duckdns.org |
| API | same domain, path-routed (`/api/*`, `/auth/*`, `/health`, `/ws/*` -- see `deploy/Caddyfile`) |
| Database | Neon Postgres (`console.neon.tech`, org `spring-hill-60129601`, `neondb` / `production` branch) |
| Source | `github.com/Shreyasg13/glassbox-trading-agents` (public, `main` branch, protected) |
| Host | GCP VM `instance-20260902-033025`, project `project-f015cf71-9e01-4a2a-8f5`, zone `us-central1-a` |
| Admin login | username `admin` + the password from `GLASSBOX_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` / `GLASSBOX_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the VM's `.env`. **No built-in default any more** (see "Security & cost hardening" below) |
| Dev viewer login | none in production. `admin`/`admin` and `user`/`user` exist only locally when `GLASSBOX_ENABLE_DEV_USERS=1` (refused if `GLASSBOX_ENV=production`) |
| Signup | `/signup` — real accounts, bcrypt-hashed, role="viewer" always |

## Next wave: platform depth (roadmap, 2026-09-04)

Six workstreams identified from a product-direction discussion, each
verified against the real codebase (not assumed) before being listed
here. Update each row's status as work begins/lands.

| # | What | Current state (verified) | What it needs | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Real agent performance/"journey" stats** -- which agents' signals were actually right, per user, over time | `db.get_agent_performance()` now aggregates real `call_count`/`success_rate`/`avg_duration_ms`/`last_active_at` per agent from the `llm_calls` log, replacing the old hardcoded mock. Deliberately does not claim a trading win-rate -- that needs linking a past signal to its later real outcome, a genuinely separate feature (still not started; see Phase 8 note below). Shown on `/dashboard` via `AgentPerformancePanel` | Real per-user/per-signal profitability tracking is the harder remaining half -- overlaps with **Phase 8** (`PHASE_7_10_AUDIT_KNOWLEDGE_PLAN.md`), read that before extending this further | ✅ Done (call-reliability stats); 📋 signal-profitability tracking still open |
| 2 | **Per-user agent subscription** -- user picks which agents run their reports; only subscribed agents run | New `/api/me/*` router (any logged-in role, not admin-gated): browse agents, save a `subscribed_agent_ids` list on your own `users` row, and `POST /api/me/run-report` runs the real seeded Investment Committee orchestration filtered to just those ids (falls back to the full committee if unset -- same "no preference = default behavior" convention item 4's watchlist uses). Self-service `/agents` page in the nav (checkboxes + a live "Run My Report" job panel, reusing the same job/WS machinery admin runs already use). Known pre-existing gap this inherits, not introduced by it: `/ws/jobs/{id}` has no auth/ownership check at all (relies on the job id being an unguessable UUID) -- true for every job kind already, not something this feature made worse, but worth fixing if job output sensitivity increases | Done for v1. Real per-signal profitability-based auto-subscription (vs. manual picking) would build on item 1's still-open half | ✅ Done |
| 3 | **13F institutional filing data** | **Does not exist anywhere in this codebase** -- confirmed by a full-repo search, zero real matches | SEC EDGAR publishes 13F filings via a free public API (no key needed) -- feasible without a paid data vendor, but is a real new ETL pipeline (quarterly filings, CIK-to-ticker mapping, storage schema) | 📋 Planned, not started |
| 4 | **Simulated test-user cohort** (5 users w/ sessions, for QA/demo) | `app/scripts/seed_demo_users.py` creates 5 real viewer accounts (`demo_growth`/`demo_income`/`demo_index`/`demo_finance`/`demo_diversified`), each with its own watchlist. Required a real feature to actually differentiate them: `/api/holdings` previously returned the identical global 15-symbol universe to every account (no per-user portfolio concept existed at all) -- it now takes an optional auth token (`get_current_user_optional`) and filters + re-normalizes weights to the caller's own watchlist when one is set, falling back to the shared view for anonymous/demo requests and any account with none (every pre-existing signup). Dashboard client-side re-fetches with the token after the server-rendered default paints (same pattern `SignalTicker` already used for live data) | Done | ✅ Done |
| 5 | **Real broker portfolio import** (Robinhood, Schwab, etc.) | The broker-connect icons on the marketing/onboarding UI are illustrative only -- no real OAuth/import wired to any broker. Notably, `Pricing.tsx`'s own copy already promises **"Broker import via SnapTrade"** on the Standard tier -- SnapTrade is a broker-aggregator API built for exactly this (one integration covers many brokers) rather than building Robinhood/Schwab/etc. individually. Robinhood has no official public API at all (unofficial/reverse-engineered access is ToS-risk territory); Schwab has a real developer API but requires app approval | A SnapTrade (or equivalent aggregator) developer account + API key -- external signup, same pattern as DuckDNS/Neon/Google OAuth this session | 📋 Planned, blocked on account creation |
| 6 | **Expose already-built API endpoints with zero UI** | `/api/track1/agents` + `/api/track2/agents` now shown via `TrackComparisonPanel` (labeled illustrative -- these are still the pre-existing static per-track reference constants, not this account's live results). `/api/monte-carlo` now shown via `StressTestPanel`, a real Monte Carlo simulation (numpy random walk seeded from this portfolio's actual historical daily-return distribution, not a canned scenario) with a day-horizon picker and an SVG fan chart of simulated paths. Both on `/dashboard` | Done | ✅ Done |
| 7 | **First-time-visitor onboarding** | Superseded by a bigger, better version: `WelcomeTour.tsx`'s standalone 4-slide product-tour carousel is retired (deleted) in favor of **GlassBox Guide**, a first-party system persona (`lib/glassboxGuide.ts`, `GuideBubble.tsx`) integrated directly into the real setup wizard (Concern → Portfolio → Verify → Alerts) with a Guide intro screen, deterministic per-step/per-selection messages (no LLM -- static UI copy, same reasoning as before), click-to-reveal metric tooltips on Step 3, and a "GlassBox is ready" summary before Dashboard. Onboarding progress now persists across refresh (localStorage -- there was previously *zero* persistence; `complete()` didn't even save anything). The old 4-slide tour is replaced by one small, dismissible `DashboardWelcomeNote` on `/dashboard` only, gated by its own flag so it never re-fires. Guide also appears in My Agents as a system-agent card (opens an info panel, not fake chat) with clearly-disabled "future agent" placeholders (Verify/Risk/Reports). Explicitly **not** an investor-persona imitation -- distinct type/visual role from the Strategy Lens personas (lensData.ts), same teal/verification visual language as the rest of the app. Optional voice reuses the existing ElevenLabs/Kokoro chain (off by default), a real, previously-unused ElevenLabs voice ("River", live-verified) deliberately not one of the 8 lens voices | Done | ✅ Done |
| 8 | **Report charts** -- `/reports/[id]` is LLM-narrated prose only, no risk/signal visualizations | `PortfolioValueChart` (real time series from `/api/data`, an SVG line, no library) + `SignalBreakdownChart` (real BUY/SELL/HOLD counts from `/api/live-signals`) now shown alongside the narrative. Honestly labeled: `DailyReportNarrative` only ever persisted the generated *text*, not the numeric data that went into it (`_build_prompt` discards it after generating), so these show the latest available data as context, not a frozen snapshot locked to that exact report's generation date | Done | ✅ Done |
| 9 | **User/product analytics** -- how people actually use the platform (page views, feature engagement) | Does not exist at all today, confirmed -- distinct from the trading-data graphs already built | Needs a decision on what to track and (if not self-hosted) which analytics provider | 📋 Planned, not scoped yet |
| 10 | **Q&A help chatbot** -- a real conversational agent answering freeform user questions about the platform | Does not exist. Explicitly scoped as separate from item 7's onboarding tour -- this is real ongoing per-query LLM cost, not a one-time static walkthrough | Needs a system prompt, a chat UI, and a cost/scope decision before building (this is a genuine recurring spend, not a one-time feature) | 📋 Planned, not started |

Not on this list because already answered directly, not planned work:
**10 years of price history is real** -- verified live on the VM, AAPL's
own parquet file spans 2016-01-04 to the present (2,523 rows), with RSI/
moving-averages/volatility already computed columns. The gap is 13F
data specifically (row 3), not historical price depth generally.

## Known gaps (disclosed, not oversights)

- **Auth is now real for signup/viewer accounts.** `/auth/signup` +
  `/signup` create genuine bcrypt-hashed accounts in a `users` table
  (`backend/app/auth.py`, `db.py`) — self-serve accounts are always
  role="viewer" (admin is never grantable via signup, by design). The
  original hardcoded `admin`/`admin` was REMOVED (it was a live admin login on the
  public deployment) -- see "Security & cost hardening" below.
  **Google sign-in is real** (`backend/app/oauth_google.py`,
  `routers/oauth.py`) — server-side OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow,
  OAuth accounts keyed on (provider, subject) with no password_hash,
  redirect back to the frontend via a URL fragment so the minted JWT
  never touches a query string or server log. Configured via
  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`; unset keeps the button returning a
  clean 503 rather than erroring. Microsoft remains honestly disabled —
  same shape of work, just not built yet.
- **Production data now lives in Neon Postgres, not the VM's local
  SQLite file.** `DATABASE_URL` set on the VM; `backend/app/db.py`
  already used plain SQLAlchemy Core with JSON-as-text columns (no
  SQLite-specific SQL), so the swap needed no query changes — just a
  driver (`psycopg`) and a dialect-aware `connect_args`/sslmode branch.
  All 7 tables' existing rows (10 agents, 57 audit-log entries, 6 jobs,
  42 llm_calls, 1 orchestration, 1 user) were copied via
  `app/scripts/migrate_to_postgres.py` and the cutover was verified live
  and definitively — not just by matching row counts, but by writing a
  new user through the live API and confirming it does NOT appear in
  the old SQLite file (which still shows only the pre-migration row),
  proving writes genuinely go to Neon now. The old SQLite file is left
  in place as a frozen pre-cutover snapshot, not an active fallback.
- **Deterministic agents don't call the real engine classes yet.** The
  "Quantitative Strategist (Engine)" etc. agents read the same live-signals
  data those classes would produce, rather than instantiating
  `BaseAgent` subclasses directly (`backend/app/orchestration.py` docstring
  has the full rationale).
- **`committee_vote`'s reduction is a confidence-weighted vote**, not a
  literal call into the source repo's `VnCalculator` — that class computes
  a different tradeoff (info/quality over agent count, not a BUY/SELL/HOLD
  reduction). Still fully deterministic/auditable.
- **Gemini free-tier RPM is very low** on the currently-wired project
  (`gen-lang-client-0725477037` / "Default Gemini Project"). A 7-agent
  parallel committee run reliably 429s most LLM agents even after three
  real bugs were found and fixed (see below) — this is a quota ceiling,
  not a code defect. **Partially addressed**: `AgentConfig.fallback_models`
  now lets a Gemini agent fall through a chain of alternate models when
  its primary is rate-limited (`app/llm_call_logging.py`), pre-filtered by
  a local best-effort quota tracker seeded with the user's own AI Studio
  dashboard numbers (`app/providers/gemini_quota.py`) — the 7 seeded LLM
  agents ship with a 9-model fallback chain. Still no sequential-mode
  orchestration fallback (only per-agent model fallback); that remains
  future work if the fallback chain alone proves insufficient under load.
- **Voice narration (Strategy Lenses, Hero demo, dashboard signal ticker)
  is live and working, now on ElevenLabs as the primary provider**
  (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`), with Hugging Face/Kokoro-82M as the fallback.
  This order flipped from an earlier Kokoro-primary version after the
  free HF tier's account-level credit quota was exhausted three times
  across two different keys during real verification (confirmed each
  time via a live `402` — not a code bug). `/api/tts` now takes two
  separate voice ids per call (`elevenlabs_voice_id`, `kokoro_voice_id`)
  since the two providers use entirely different id namespaces — all 8
  Strategy Lens personas were assigned real ElevenLabs voice ids fetched
  live from `GET /v2/voices` with a real key (`lensData.ts`), not
  guessed. `generate_speech()` confirmed live end-to-end (real MP3 bytes
  back from ElevenLabs, 2026-09-04).
- **Mobile/cross-browser audio playback hardened**: `useLensVoice.ts` now
  reuses one persistent `<audio>` element (synchronously primed on the
  first real user click) instead of a fresh `new Audio()` per call — the
  standard fix for mobile Safari/WebKit's autoplay policy, which blocks
  `.play()` unless it's directly attributable to a user gesture and an
  `await fetch(...)` before playback (as this feature's async TTS fetch
  requires) breaks that attribution on a freshly-created element. Applied
  at every real click site (voice toggle, per-row speak buttons, Hero's
  Listen button, Strategy Lenses' card/arrow navigation). Not verified on
  a real iOS device from this environment — the fix follows the
  widely-documented pattern, but hasn't been confirmed hands-on.
- **A6 Audit Activity feed is currently mockup copy**, not a real running
  check — Phase 7 makes it real.
- **Live trading data is point-in-time** until the daily cron job's next
  run (`0 22 * * 1-5` UTC on the VM) — see `docs/DEPLOY_GCP.md` §6b.

## Real bugs found and fixed this session (worth knowing for future debugging)

1. **CORS only ever allowed `localhost:3000`** — blocked every real browser
   login on the deployed site since the first deployment; every `curl`-based
   "verified live" check missed it because curl ignores CORS. Fixed via
   `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var.
2. **Gemini API key leaking into error messages** — found during the Phase 6
   secrets audit, before it ever shipped.
3. **Frontend Dockerfile assumed a `public/` dir existed** — first VM deploy
   failed on it; the directory was empty/never created.
4. **Gemini model name churn** — `gemini-2.0-flash` → `gemini-2.5-flash` (also
   retired) → now on the `gemini-flash-latest` alias to resist future churn.
5. **Gemini "thinking" tokens silently consuming `maxOutputTokens`** — up to
   517 of a 600-token budget spent on invisible reasoning, truncating the
   visible answer mid-sentence. Fixed with `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget=0`.
6. **Retry-with-backoff getting killed by the outer per-call timeout** — a
   429 retry's own backoff exceeded the 30s timeout wrapping it, converting
   a recoverable error into an unrecoverable one. Fixed by widening the
   timeout budget consistently (provider timeout, launch stagger,
   orchestration limits) instead of just adding a retry in isolation.
7. **Shared circuit-breaker cascading failures** — `get_provider()` caches
   one singleton per provider name, so 3 independent agents' legitimate
   rate-limit failures tripped a breaker that then blocked every *other*
   agent's attempt too. Fixed by raising `failure_threshold` to tolerate a
   burst across multiple agents sharing one instance.

## Phase 11 — Strategy Lenses + Pilot Production landing additions

Sourced from `GlassBox_Pilot_Production.html` (plan/content) and
`GlassBox_Lenses_Interactive.html` (the exact interactive spec — full
persona data, 3D carousel mechanics, animation timings). Landing-page
content, no backend dependency — can be built independently of Phases 7–10.

1. **Strategy Lenses** — 8 investor-archetype cards in a 3D perspective
   carousel: Value (Buffett/Munger), GARP (Lynch), Multi-Strat (Griffin),
   Macro (Dalio), Quant (Simons), Allocation (Englander), Algo (Shaw),
   Reflexive (Soros). Each has a procedurally-generated SVG portrait
   (explicitly NOT a real likeness), a growth/risk bar chart, a typewriter
   "speak" quote in first person, filter chips (All/Value-GARP/Quant/
   Macro/Multi-Strategy), autoplay, drag-to-slide, keyboard nav.
   **The mandatory legal disclaimer** ("original AI archetypes... NOT
   affiliated with, endorsed by, or representing any named investor,"
   portraits "original illustrations, not likenesses") ships with this,
   visibly, not buried in a footer.
2. **"ML Provenance" section** — data/model transparency explainer
   (institutional sources / deterministic core / narrative models / audit
   layer).
3. **Sliding agent/lens marquee banner** under the nav.
4. **5-star score-review feedback widget** — "Was this useful?"

**Status: build in progress.**

### Landing-page addendum ("Plan-correction.MD") progress

A follow-up product-direction doc (referred to in commit messages as
`Plan-correction.MD`) split this into workstreams. Note: that file
itself isn't checked into this repo — confirmed by a full home-directory
search — so its content only survives in commit messages/code comments
right now. If it still exists somewhere, worth adding it under `docs/`
so the rationale doesn't rot into "trust the commit log."

- **Workstream A — Done** (commit `0569bb7`, 2026-09-07): Strategy Lens
  completion tracking (`heardLenses`, tracked against the full persona
  set so filtering can't early-trigger it); a one-time "GlassBox finale"
  voice moment (`GUIDE_LANDING_FINALE_MESSAGE`) that hands off from the
  investor lens voices to the GlassBox system voice (River/am_onyx,
  reused from `GuideBubble`, now exported from `lib/glassboxGuide.ts`
  instead of duplicated); a dedicated `ConversionCTA` section
  (`#glassbox-verify`) between the Lens carousel and the rest of the
  landing page, deliberately not claiming a specific free-signal number
  since backend enforcement didn't exist yet at that point; and a
  floating `AgentLauncher` "Ask GlassBox" shell that never fakes command
  execution for logged-out visitors (every submission gets the same
  honest "create an account" response — no intent parsing behind it).
- **Workstream B/C — Not started**: real intent parsing and real
  verification runs from natural language behind `AgentLauncher` (it's
  still just a shell today).
- **Backend-enforced free-tier entitlements — implemented, tested, and
  committed.** This is what Workstream A's "avoid claiming an unenforced
  quota" note was blocking on: `POST /api/me/verify/{ticker}` and
  `GET /api/me/entitlements` (`backend/app/routers/me.py`) give every
  real (non-dev) account 5 free deterministic signal verifications,
  metered on their own `users` row (`verified_signal_count`), 402 once
  exhausted. Surfaced on the dashboard via a new `VerifySignalPanel`.
  Full backend suite (106 tests, including 8 new ones for this) passes,
  and the frontend type-checks clean — verified 2026-09-07. Not yet
  deployed to the VM, and `ConversionCTA`/`AgentLauncher` copy still
  doesn't reference the real "5 free" number.
- **Onboarding "Choose your agent" step — implemented, tested, and
  committed (2026-09-07).** A new step 0 in `OnboardingFlow.tsx`
  (`StepAgent.tsx`) lets the user pick one of 6 onboarding-only agent
  personas (`agentPersonas.ts` — deliberately separate from the 8
  landing-page Strategy Lens personas and from the real
  `/api/me/agent-subscriptions` feature; purely cosmetic, themes the
  wizard's color/voice/copy). Persistent `AgentHero` sidebar card shows
  the chosen agent with an optional "Hear this agent" voice button.
  **Voice-id caveat**: unlike the 8 Strategy Lens voices and the Guide's
  "River" voice (each fetched live from `GET /v2/voices` with a real
  `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and confirmed against this account), the 6 new
  agents' `elevenLabsVoiceId`/`kokoroVoiceId` were assigned with no key
  available in this environment — they're long-stable public
  ElevenLabs premade-catalog ids (Antoni, Arnold, Josh, Rachel, Bella,
  Domi), not fetched/confirmed live this session. Verify with a real key
  next time the VM/key is reachable, same bar the rest of the voice
  work holds itself to.

## Phase 12 — Liquid glass, voice captions, dashboard insights (2026-09-08)

Sourced from a design-exploration prototype the user iterated on
separately (`glassbox-onboarding-upgrade(9).html`, a standalone static
mockup in Downloads — never part of this repo, has no deploy path, and
was never connected to the real app). Three pieces ported into the real
codebase, committed locally (not yet pushed/deployed):

1. **Liquid-glass frosted surface** — `.glass-panel-frost` /
   `.glass-frost-surface` in `globals.css` (real `backdrop-filter`,
   re-themed light/dark via dedicated vars, same pattern as the existing
   `--c-glass-nav-bg`). `GlassPanel` gained a `"frost"` variant.
   AgentHero.tsx already had real frosted glass before this; applied now
   to OnboardingFlow.tsx's four card wrappers (intro screen, sidebar
   Guide card, main wizard card, complete screen), which were flat
   `bg-panel` before. **Not yet applied** to dashboard panels generally —
   only the two new ones below use it; retrofitting existing panels
   (PortfolioOverviewPanel, StressTestPanel, etc.) to `variant="frost"`
   is a follow-up, not done this pass.
2. **Live word-by-word captions on the Guide's voice** —
   `useLensVoice.speak()` takes an optional `onProgress(fraction)`,
   wired to the shared `<audio>` element's real `timeupdate` event
   (genuine playback position, not a guessed timer). `GuideBubble`
   highlights words in sequence, weighted by character length against
   the real elapsed fraction. Does **not** change the deliberate
   "never autoplay" behavior — captions only run inside an already
   explicit `speak()` call from a real click, same as before.
3. **Dashboard: sector-allocation donut + Insights & Alert Signals
   panel** — both real, no new backend endpoint. The donut aggregates
   the same real `holdings[].sector`/`weight` fields
   PortfolioOverviewPanel already tables, re-fetching `/api/holdings`
   client-side with the auth token so it personalizes the same way that
   panel does (a first version of this that only used the server-fetched
   default would have quietly diverged from it for logged-in users with
   a watchlist — caught and fixed before committing). The insights panel
   derives alert-worthy rows from the same live-signals feed
   `SignalTicker` already renders (rsi/ma_cross/volume_ratio/confidence),
   applying standard technical thresholds (RSI 75/25, MA-cross flips,
   ≥1.8x volume, ≥70% confidence) — one insight per symbol, first
   matching rule wins, explicitly labeled as derived from the live
   signal feed and **not** a claim about the real A6 Audit feed (which
   remains its own, still-mockup thing, unaffected by this).

**Verified:** `npm run build` compiles clean (type-check + lint pass,
zero errors). Backend's existing 106 pytest tests still pass (no
backend files touched this pass). Local dev server (frontend :3000 +
backend :8000, backend run against a fresh local SQLite, not Neon)
served both `/onboarding` and `/dashboard` with 200s and no server-side
exceptions logged. **Not verified:** an actual authenticated-browser
visual check (glass blur rendering as intended, caption sync feeling
right against real ElevenLabs audio, donut/insights panel layout) —
every `(app)` route sits behind `AppShell`'s client-only auth `loading`
gate (token lives in `localStorage`, structurally unreachable from a
plain `curl` request, confirmed by reading `lib/auth.tsx`), so this
needs a real logged-in browser session next time one's available in the
environment. Also not done: pushing to `origin`, touching
`docker-compose.yml`/`deploy/Caddyfile`, or deploying to the VM — local
commits on `main` only, by design for this pass.

## Phase 13 — Portfolio growth/stats panels, voice + layout fixes (2026-09-11)

Three commits, pushed to `origin/main` this session (bundled with
Phase 12's own commits — the liquid-glass surface, captions, and the
sector-allocation donut/insights panel — which had been sitting local
since 2026-09-08). Not yet deployed to the VM as of this writing.

1. **`PortfolioGrowthPanel`** — timeframe-toggled (7D/30D/90D/ALL) chart
   over the real `/api/data` series; ranges longer than the on-disk
   sample are disabled and clearly marked rather than silently
   truncated.
2. **`StatsBoard`** — surfaces the already-computed but previously
   unused `/api/daily-summary` risk/return metrics (Sharpe, max
   drawdown, win rate) plus new real P&L/turnover numbers from a new
   `GET /api/portfolio-stats` (`data_source.get_portfolio_stats`): FIFO
   realized-P&L matching and unrealized P&L from live prices, ported
   from `backend-source/DAILY_PNL.py`'s `DailyPnLTracker` rather than
   reimplemented. `has_trade_history` distinguishes a real zero from
   "no trades recorded yet" so an empty `portfolio.json`/`trades.json`
   renders an honest empty state instead of misleading zeros.
3. **`MissedOpportunitiesPanel`** — derives "strong signal, no matching
   trade" candidates client-side (same pattern `InsightsAlertsPanel`
   already uses), with an admin-only "Generate AI take" action hitting
   a new `POST /api/insights/narrate` background job (mirrors
   `reports.py`'s `generate_report` machinery: `complete_with_logging`,
   audit log, WS/poll status) that narrates the candidates it's handed
   rather than re-deriving its own definition server-side.
4. Two bugfixes riding along: `useLensVoice`'s `<audio>` element was
   per-hook-instance, so `GuideBubble` and `AgentHero` (both mounted at
   once in the onboarding sidebar) could genuinely play two voices
   concurrently — moved to module-level shared state so starting
   playback anywhere pauses whatever else was playing. And the
   onboarding sidebar's Guide bubble was clipping text mid-word because
   `min-w-0` was missing through the flex chain in the fixed-220px
   column — added `min-w-0`/`break-words`/`flex-wrap` through it.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` clean, all 106 existing backend pytest
tests still pass, and a live logged-in dashboard screenshot confirmed
every new panel renders against real data with no console errors. This
also stands in for Phase 12's previously-outstanding authenticated-
browser check (donut/insights panel, liquid-glass surface) since
they're on the same dashboard page — captions weren't specifically
re-checked this pass.

## Phase 13b — Onboarding wizard fixes (2026-09-11)

A follow-up bug report against the onboarding wizard (`/onboarding`,
"Step 1 of 5" screen) listed six issues. Checked each against the real
running app (backend :8000 + frontend :3000, logged in as `user`) via
Playwright screenshots before touching anything, since two were
already fixed by Phase 13's `3f30b90`/`c022e17`:

- Guide copilot card clipped / audio button truncated / text
  overflowing the main panel — **already fixed**, no reproduction at
  1400x900 or 400x900.
- Left sidebar cards overlapping the main panel — **already fixed**,
  same screenshots.
- Wizard Back/Continue navigation — **already present**
  (`OnboardingFlow.tsx`'s Cancel/Back + Continue/Finish footer).
- Stepper filled progress + inactive-label contrast — **real, fixed**:
  the current-step segment was only 35%-opacity teal and inactive
  labels used `--c-t4` (`#98a6c0` on white in light theme, barely
  legible) — `StepIndicator.tsx` now fills every segment through the
  current step solid teal and raises inactive labels to `--c-t3`.
- Main panel scroll / Risk meter cut off at the bottom — **real,
  fixed and reproduced first**: at a real 760px-tall viewport the step
  card had no height bound, so the Risk meter and the Back/Continue
  footer ran under the fold with the page's own un-cued scroll as the
  only way to reach them (`scrollHeight` 993 vs `clientHeight` 760).
  `OnboardingFlow.tsx`'s card is now capped at `calc(100vh-180px)`
  with its content independently scrollable and the nav footer pinned
  outside that scroll region — footer always reachable, rest scrolls
  into view.
- Agent carousel/pagination — **real, fixed and reproduced first**: 6
  agent cards don't all fit below ~1000px wide (reproduced at 400px
  and 900px — two of six scrolled out of view with zero affordance
  that more existed). `StepAgent.tsx` gained prev/next paging buttons
  over the existing scroll rail, shown/hidden off the rail's real
  `scrollLeft`/`scrollWidth`.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` clean. Playwright screenshots + scroll-state
checks at 1400x900, 1400x760, and 400x900 confirm no clipping/overlap,
the Risk bar and footer both reachable at the short viewport, and the
paging arrows correctly reveal the two hidden agents with zero console
errors along the way.

## Phase 14 — Aria onboarding revert + dashboard liquid-glass charts (2026-09-11)

Two independent bug reports, both against the live app, addressed in
one pass:

**Onboarding: reverted to a single Aria hero, 4 steps.** The 6-agent
picker step (Allocation/Value/Quant/Macro/Reflexive/GlassBox, built in
an earlier phase) plus the separate "GlassBox Guide" copilot card next
to it were the actual bug the report was describing: one guide persona
shown twice, once generically and once "in character." Cross-checked
against the user's own reference mockup
(`glassbox-onboarding-upgrade(9).html` in Downloads), which has exactly
this shape already. Deleted `StepAgent.tsx`/`AgentHero.tsx`/
`AgentAvatar.tsx`/`agentPersonas.ts` (confirmed nothing outside
onboarding imported them first), added `AriaHero.tsx` as the one
consolidated hero card, trimmed the flow to 4 steps (Concern → Portfolio
→ Verify → Alerts), and renamed `GLASSBOX_GUIDE.name` "GlassBox Guide" →
"Aria" (propagates everywhere via the constant). Footer nav fixed:
Continue is `ml-auto` + `min-w-[170px]`, not full-width, so Back no
longer reads as stranded at the far edge.

**Dashboard: Robinhood-style growth chart + liquid glass everywhere.**
`PortfolioGrowthPanel` now renders a smoothed (Catmull-Rom, still every
real data point) gradient-fill area chart colored by real direction,
with a hover crosshair. `StatsBoard` tiles gained real direction arrows
and ring gauges for Win Rate/Churn Rate (fed from each metric's own
real scalar — no fabricated sparkline history for point-in-time
metrics that don't have any). Every remaining dashboard panel
(`AgentPerformancePanel`, `PortfolioOverviewPanel`, `StressTestPanel`,
`TrackComparisonPanel`, `VerifySignalPanel`) switched from the flat
`accent` variant to `frost`, so the whole dashboard now shares one
consistent glass treatment instead of about half of it.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` and `next build` both clean. Playwright
through the full onboarding flow (1400×900 and 420×900) and a full
dashboard screenshot, logged in as `user` — no console errors beyond
the pre-existing, unrelated data-theme hydration warning. **Not yet
verified:** an actual VM deploy of this phase.

**Found but not fixed (pre-existing, out of scope):**
`StepPortfolio.tsx`'s "Connect portfolio" tab nests an `ExplainTooltip`
button inside a `<button>` — a real nested-interactive-element
hydration warning, unrelated to either change above. Flagging for a
future pass.

## Post-Phase-14 fix — voice narration cache bug (2026-09-11)

User report: navigating onboarding steps didn't stop/refresh narration
correctly -- audio from a previous step kept playing (or replaying)
against the wrong screen. Root cause found by instrumenting real
`/api/tts` calls, not guessed: `useLensVoice.speak()`'s cache was keyed
by `personaId` alone. Aria narrates a different message every step
under that one same id, so after step 1's line was cached, every later
step silently replayed step 1's audio with zero new network requests
-- captions/on-screen text moved on, the sound never did. Fixed by
keying the cache `${personaId}::${text}` and having `stop()` also bump
the request-id guard (covers a fetch still in flight when stop() is
called with nothing new queued). Verified: an instrumented run through
4 real step transitions showed exactly 1 `/api/tts` request before the
fix vs. 4 correct ones after. Deployed.

## New requests to track, not yet scoped (2026-09-11)

Bundled together in one message; none of this is started. Listed here
so it isn't lost, per the user's own ask to track rather than rush it:

- **Aria's avatar** -- currently the same plain checkmark badge used
  for the small nav-icon Guide avatar everywhere else. User wants
  something more expressive/animated ("Pixar-style" character), shared
  via low-res Google Images search-result thumbnails (not usable
  directly as a real asset -- provenance/licensing/resolution all
  wrong for a production app) -- needs a real illustrated/animated
  asset sourced or commissioned properly, not scraped.
- **"Meet the team" entry point** on the home/dashboard screen, tied to
  an animated character, redirecting into the marketing landing page's
  existing Strategy-Lens-carousel flow.
- **Lip-sync / more realistic voice-driven animation** for Aria while
  she's speaking (today: word-by-word text caption highlighting only,
  no visual mouth/face animation).
- **A small HTML or Figma prototype** of the above, for review before
  it's built into the real app -- user's own explicit ask, so this
  should be the actual first deliverable for this bucket, not a full
  implementation.
- **Bigger animated GB logo** on the marketing landing page, placed
  between the "See the data. Invest smarter." tagline and the
  "Live verification / A6 Auditor active" stat panel -- "fun Pixar
  style" animation of the GlassBox mark specifically (separate from
  the Aria-character ask above).
- **Notification panel** -- flagged as entirely missing; not yet
  scoped (which events, where it lives, badge/count behavior all TBD).
- **Mobile compatibility** -- flagged as a "major problem," open on a
  real mobile device rather than a resized desktop browser (Playwright
  viewport tests at 400-420px width across onboarding/dashboard this
  session showed no breakage, so this needs to be characterized on an
  actual phone before it can be diagnosed) -- user marked this as
  priority-before-more-design-work.

## Task list

- [ ] **New, flagged priority:** Characterize the real mobile-compat
      bug (device/browser, which page, what actually happens) before
      attempting a fix -- viewport-resize testing hasn't reproduced
      anything so far, so this needs a real device or its exact repro.
- [ ] **New:** Build a small HTML/Figma prototype for Aria's
      avatar/animation + landing-page "meet the team" flow + bigger
      animated logo placement, for review before real implementation.
- [ ] **New:** Scope and build a notification panel (nothing decided
      yet -- events, placement, badge behavior).
- [x] Deploy Phase 14 to the VM — same `git archive` + `gcloud compute
      scp` convention, this time with the VM's tracked directories
      cleared before extraction (plain tar-over-existing doesn't
      remove files a commit deleted, e.g. the retired agent-picker
      components) so the VM matches the repo exactly. Both containers
      up clean, `/health`, `/onboarding`, and `/dashboard` all 200 on
      the live domain post-deploy.
- [ ] **New:** Fix `StepPortfolio.tsx`'s nested button
      (`ExplainTooltip` inside the "Connect portfolio" tab) — real
      hydration warning, found during Phase 14's verification, not
      part of either change in that phase.
- [x] Retrofit the remaining dashboard panels to `GlassPanel
      variant="frost"` (done in Phase 14).
- [x] Push Phase 12 + 13's commits (done this session).
- [x] Deploy Phase 12/13/13b to the VM — `git archive` tarball
      (deploy convention this repo actually uses; `.env` preserved,
      not overwritten) shipped via `gcloud compute scp`, extracted
      over `~/glassbox`, `docker compose up -d --build`. Both
      containers came up clean (`docker compose ps`/logs show no
      errors) and `https://glassbox-portfolio-review.duckdns.org/health`
      returns `{"status":"ok"}` post-deploy.
- [ ] Deploy the free-tier entitlements/verify-signal feature (committed
      2026-09-07, not yet deployed to the VM), then update
      `ConversionCTA`/`AgentLauncher` copy to reference the real "5 free"
      quota.
- [ ] Decide: build Phase 7 (Stock Analysis + real A6 audit) next?
- [ ] Decide: sequential-mode fallback for LLM committee runs (works around
      the Gemini RPM ceiling without needing a paid tier)?
- [ ] Decide: news API provider for Phase 9, once reached.
- [x] Real user auth (replace hardcoded dev accounts) — done, see "Security & cost hardening".
- [ ] Consider pushing the `glassbox` repo's visibility/CI setup if the
      project moves toward a team rather than solo-dev workflow.

## Security & cost hardening (2026-09-19)

Backend pass aimed at "safe to demo publicly and cheap to run". Everything
below is free/open-source -- no new paid services, no new containers.

**Auth**
- Removed the hardcoded `admin`/`admin` and `user`/`user` logins. Admin is now
  `admin` + a password supplied only via env (`GLASSBOX_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`
  bcrypt, preferred, or `GLASSBOX_ADMIN_PASSWORD` >= 12 chars). Unset = no admin.
  Dev logins exist only with `GLASSBOX_ENABLE_DEV_USERS=1` and never in production.
- `GLASSBOX_ENV=production` (set in docker-compose.yml) makes the backend refuse
  to boot with a missing/default `GLASSBOX_JWT_SECRET`.
- JWT: `python-jose` (open CVEs) replaced by **PyJWT**; algorithm pinned, `exp` +
  `sub` required, malformed role claims are 401 not 500, tokens carry `iat`.
- Passwords: min 10 chars, max 72 bytes (bcrypt truncates silently), common-
  password and password==username rejected. bcrypt runs in a threadpool.
- Login: unknown-user and wrong-password take the same time; per-IP limit plus a
  per-account failed-attempt lockout (20 / 15 min, temporary).

**Rate limiting** -- the old limiter only ever saw Caddy's IP, so all visitors shared
one bucket. The Dockerfile now trusts Caddy's X-Forwarded-For
(`--forwarded-allow-ips`; port 8000 must stay unpublished). Added limits for
/api/tts (cache misses only), /api/monte-carlo, per-user report runs
(6/hour) and verify; the limiter's memory is bounded.

**Cost control** -- /api/tts audio is cached (memory + `/data/tts-cache` on the
existing volume) and concurrent identical requests share one provider call;
ElevenLabs is skipped after `TTS_DAILY_CHAR_BUDGET` chars/day. Provider failures
are now logged (status + error code only) and each response carries an
`X-TTS-Provider: cache|elevenlabs|kokoro` header. `/api/monte-carlo` is bounded
and vectorized (~100x faster).

**Dependencies** -- fastapi 0.115 -> 0.141 (starlette 0.38 -> 1.6), pyarrow, yfinance /
curl_cffi, pydantic, uvicorn upgraded and pinned; `pip-audit` reports no known
vulnerabilities (was ~30). CI (`.github/workflows/backend.yml`) runs tests +
pip-audit; Dependabot watches pip/npm/docker/actions.

**Edge** -- Caddy adds HSTS, nosniff, frame-deny, referrer/permissions policies, a
1 MB body cap, and hides the Server header. CORS methods/headers are allow-listed;
/auth responses are `no-store`; the signals websocket is capped at 300 connections.

**Deliberately NOT done yet** (each needs a decision or a testable environment):
- Content-Security-Policy: needs nonce support in the Next.js frontend first.
- Running the backend container as non-root: needs the `glassbox-db` volume and
  `./trading-storage` bind mount re-owned, and the daily-sync cron re-tested.
- `uvicorn.workers` is deprecated upstream (works in the pinned uvicorn); move to
  the `uvicorn-worker` package before unpinning uvicorn.
- `GET /api/reports/narratives/{id}` is still public (UUID-guarded) -- decide
  whether shared report links are intended.
- Redis-backed rate limits (only needed once there is more than one VM).

## Phase 1 -- paper trading, backtests and the admin master view (2026-09-19)

**Deployed 2026-09-20** (commit 8d74a82): bootstrapped on the VM (27 accounts, live tracking from 2026-09-19) and the daily cron added (`15 22 * * 1-5`, after the data sync). The first live day and the first 11 reports arrive with Monday 2026-09-21's run.

**What exists now.** The quant engine's BUY/SELL/HOLD signals drive simulated
portfolios so the strategy can be measured. Nothing places real orders.

- `app/paper.py` -- the engine (no DB, no network). Orders decided at day D's
  close fill at D+1's close (no look-ahead), 5 bps costs, long-only, no leverage.
  Strategies: `engine_tilt` (target weight = invested x strategic weight x the
  engine's own 1.5x / 1.0x / 0.5x suggested-weight tilt; SELL raises cash),
  `static_rebalanced` (same weights and rebalancing, signals ignored -- each
  profile's benchmark, so alpha = what the signals added), `static_hold`,
  `random_tilt` (a placebo: each symbol acts on ANOTHER symbol's real signal
  history) and `cash`. Days before `live_from` are tagged **backtest**
  (in-sample: the trained params were fitted on this same history); days after
  are **live** (genuine out-of-sample).
- `app/paper_profiles.py` -- the 11-profile cohort (growth, income, index,
  financials, diversified, 60/40, all-weather, quality, momentum, cyclical,
  capital preservation). Every profile gets an account + benchmark **without
  needing a login**; the demo logins (`seed_demo_users`) are optional.
- `app/paper_cycle.py` + `python -m app.scripts.run_paper_cycle` -- the daily
  cycle. `--bootstrap` (once) creates 27 accounts (11 profiles, 11 benchmarks,
  5 controls: SPY, equal-weight, engine-on-all, placebo, cash) and backfills from
  2021-01-04 (includes the 2022 bear market); the daily run replays new days,
  stores the day's signals and writes one report per profile (provider
  `system`) so **Admin -> Reports is no longer empty**. Idempotent.
- Admin: **Admin -> Paper Trading** (leaderboard, equity curve vs benchmark,
  holdings, trades, signal scorecard, "run now"). API: `/api/admin/paper/*`.
- Cron (add after the data sync; see docs/DEPLOY_GCP.md 6b):
  `15 22 * * 1-5 cd ~/glassbox && docker compose exec -T backend python -m app.scripts.run_paper_cycle >> logs/paper_cycle.log 2>&1`

**Gemini reliability (why 40 of 46 LLM calls failed).** 21x 429 (the free tier is
5 req/min and only 20/day on flash models), 14x 404 (invented model ids in the
fallback chain), 4x 503. Now: a 404 is remembered for 24h and never retried;
the fallback chain is narrowed to models the key's own ListModels offers
(fail-open); diagnostics at `GET /api/admin/providers/gemini/models`. The daily
paper cycle does NOT depend on any LLM -- reports are factual templates; an
optional AI note is off unless `PAPER_LLM_NARRATIVES=1`. Free-tier quota itself
is unchanged: LLM agents still get 20 flash calls/day; enable billing to lift it.

**First findings (real data, 2021-01-04 to 2026-09-18, in-sample -- read with care).**
- The SELL signal is counter-productive: prices after a SELL rose *more* than
  average (5-day edge -0.46 pts). BUY has a real edge (+0.78 pts at 5 days, 63% hit rate).
- Engine on all 15 symbols: +133% vs +124% for the placebo, +120% SPY, +213%
  equal-weight buy-and-hold. The engine holds ~20% cash in a bull market.
- Per-profile alpha vs policy benchmark ranges from -7.1% (growth) to +14.5% (quality).
These are the targets for Phase 3 (re-weighting, challenger orchestrations).

**Not built yet:** Phase 2 (richer admin dashboard: attribution, calibration,
drawdown views), Phase 3 (shadow challengers, proposals queue, re-weighting),
per-agent recommendation logging for the LLM committee, per-user paper portfolios
for real customers.

## LLM failover routing (2026-09-20)

Billing is not enabled on the Gemini key, whose free tier is ~20 requests/day on
flash models -- so the Investment Committee could never finish. Requests now fail
over instead of stalling (full guide: docs/FREE_LLM_ROUTING.md).

- `app/providers/openai_compat.py` -- one class for every OpenAI-compatible host:
  OpenRouter (free `:free` models + the `openrouter/free` auto-router, discovered
  live), Groq, Cerebras, GitHub Models, Qwen (DashScope), DeepSeek, xAI Grok and a
  custom `gateway` slot (OmniRoute / LiteLLM / vLLM ...). Errors carry only the
  provider name + HTTP status, never a key, URL, prompt or response body.
- `app/llm_router.py` -- `complete_routed()`: the requested provider first, then a
  failover order; a quota error puts a provider to rest (~1h for a per-day limit)
  so it is not hammered; failover targets get their own model ids; total time
  budget; if nothing else is usable the original error is raised unchanged.
- Wired into agent runs, report/insight narration and the daily paper-report note.
  Agent results record the provider that really answered (`failed_over_from`).
- Admin -> Observability: routing table + "Test failover"; `/api/admin/providers/routing[/test]`.
- **A provider with no key is skipped -- nothing changes until a key is added.**
- Privacy: failover providers see the prompt; `LLM_FAILOVER_USER_RUNS=0` keeps
  end-user runs off third parties.

## CI-built images and pull-based deploys (2026-09-20)

Images are built and tested in GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/images.yml`), pushed to Google
Artifact Registry with keyless Workload Identity auth, and pulled on the VM by
`deploy/deploy.sh <tag>` (health-checked, auto-rollback). The VM no longer builds anything.
Backend image is now multi-stage (no compiler at runtime). Compose gained healthchecks,
memory limits and log rotation. Guide: docs/DEPLOY_IMAGES.md.

## Daily Investment Committee review (2026-09-20)

The 10-agent committee now runs on its own every weekday at 22:30 UTC (after the 22:00 data
sync and 22:15 paper cycle) -- `app/committee_daily.py`, `python -m app.scripts.run_committee_daily`.

- Reviews a few symbols a day: engine BUY/SELL and just-changed signals, topped up with the biggest
  movers (~2-3 runs, 14-21 model calls). Idempotent per date+symbol; a holiday is a no-op.
- The agents are now GROUNDED: the prompt carries the real numbers (price, signal + confidence, RSI,
  MA cross, returns, drawdown, volatility, in-sample backtest quality) and demands a
  `Decision: BUY|SELL|HOLD` line. Previously they received only a ticker.
- Fixed a vote-parsing bias: an LLM reply was scanned for BUY before SELL before HOLD regardless
  of position, so "HOLD -- I wouldn't buy here" counted as BUY. Now the Decision line wins, else the
  earliest of the three words.
- Every decision is stored (`committee_runs`) with votes, per-agent lean/summary, providers used and
  quorum; a daily report goes to Admin -> Reports; Admin -> Paper Trading has the panel, a preview,
  a "Review now" button and (as history builds) a scorecard: forward returns of its calls and how
  often it just echoed the engine. That scorecard is the input for the Phase 3 self-improvement loop.

### Committee hardening after the first live run (2026-09-20)

- **Overlap guard is now a database lock.** The first version was a module global; production runs 2 gunicorn
  workers plus a separate cron process, so it guarded nothing and `/runs` reported `running: false` from
  whichever worker answered (an admin polling it stopped early and thought the run had died). The lock is a
  reserved `__lock__` row in `committee_runs`: atomic INSERT to acquire, compare-and-swap takeover after
  `COMMITTEE_DAILY_BUDGET_S + 900 s` so a crashed run cannot block the schedule, owner-checked release.
  Verified live: held while a run is in flight (seen from separate processes), a second run exits 1
  ("already running"), released afterwards.
- **Provider API keys were being logged.** Gemini takes its key as `?key=...` and httpx logs each request
  URL at INFO. httpx/httpcore are now WARNING (API process and both cron scripts). A key that already
  appeared in a log or a terminal should be rotated.
- `report_written: false` on a re-run is correct: the report id fingerprints the outcomes, so an identical
  re-run does not create a duplicate.

## Phase 2 -- LangGraph committee, risk signal, tax lens, Strategy console (2026-09-20)

Goal: a stable, long-horizon, tax-aware system (daily closes, weeks-to-years decisions; no intraday), with
clear visibility for the admin and for users.

**Engine**
- `app/committee_graph.py`: the daily committee is a LangGraph `StateGraph` -- fan-out (one `Send` per agent) ->
  `run_agent` x10 concurrently -> `aggregate` (deterministic confidence-weighted vote, never an LLM judge) ->
  `risk_gate`. Analysts are LangChain chains (`prompt | RoutedChatModel | PydanticOutputParser`) returning a
  validated `{decision, confidence, risk_level, rationale}`; a non-JSON reply still votes via the old text rule.
  `app/llm_chat.py` wraps `llm_router.complete_routed` as a LangChain chat model, so failover, cooldowns and the
  call ledger are unchanged. Self-reported confidence is clamped to 0.3-0.8 (uncalibrated). The admin's manual
  Orchestrations page keeps its existing runner.
- `app/risk.py`: rule-based, no-lookahead risk regime (vol percentile 45% + drawdown 35% + trend break 20%) with an
  out-of-sample scorecard. Mostly a volatility detector; it lags a sudden onset (documented, and shown as such).
  The committee's risk gate holds a BUY back to HOLD when the regime is HIGH (`COMMITTEE_RISK_GATE=0` disables);
  the vote is kept, the gated result is stored as `action`.
- `app/paper.py`: FIFO tax lots (short vs long term), estimated tax / after-tax return / avg holding period
  (`PAPER_TAX_ST` 32%, `PAPER_TAX_LT` 15% assumed -- estimates, not advice); new `committee_tilt` strategy and a
  `ctl_committee` control ("Committee on all symbols"), identical to the engine control except where the committee
  reviewed a symbol in the last 5 trading days. It can only differ on live days.
- `python -m app.scripts.run_paper_cycle --rebuild [--apply]`: replays every stored account from its own stored
  definition and applies the result only where it reproduces the stored equity curve to the cent -- this is how
  accounts created before tax tracking gain their lots without changing any history.
- Schedule is now 22:00 data sync -> **22:15 committee** -> **22:45 paper cycle** (the cycle also waits for a review
  still in progress).

**Visibility**
- Admin -> **Strategy** (`/admin/strategy`): CEO view (call, consensus, engine-trio vs analyst-panel, dissent, risk
  check; inspector for all 10 agents incl. prompt and raw reply), **Ask the committee** (sandbox prompt console,
  never a decision), **Is it working?** (engine / risk / committee accuracy with sample sizes; agent leaderboard,
  unranked until 30 scored BUY/SELL calls), **Capital & tax** (curves + after-tax table).
- Users: **Today's stance** on the dashboard (attention / elevated-risk watch / quiet -- elevated risk alone never
  shouts) and **Track record** (`/track-record`; reference strategies only, backtest vs live labelled, tax lens).
- Fixed on the way: the app-shell grid used `1fr` (automatic minimum), so a wide table could widen the whole page
  on tablet widths; now `minmax(0,1fr)`.

**Not done (deliberately)**: agent re-weighting / self-tuning (needs ~100 scored decisions per agent, roughly 2-3
months at 2-3 reviews a day; the leaderboard is the input and will say when), intraday anything.

## Tax-aware engine and taxable / sheltered ledgers (2026-09-21)

Finding that motivated it: on the real backtest the plain engine returned +133% before tax but only +102% after
an estimated tax (mostly short-term gains, ~7x capital turnover), versus +120% for holding SPY and +213% for
equal-weight buy-and-hold. The engine's SELL signal had negative in-sample edge.

- **`engine_taxaware`** (account `ctl_taxaware`, taxable wrapper): sells lots in tax order (losses, then long-term
  gains, then short-term gains); a short-term GAIN lot is locked unless that symbol's risk regime is HIGH; a signal
  must persist 5 trading days before it is acted on; wider rebalance bands (10% drift, ~quarterly, 1% min trade);
  a BUY into a HIGH-risk regime is held at HOLD. All parameters (`TA_*` in `app/paper.py`) were fixed in advance,
  NOT tuned on the backtest -- tuning on the same history it is judged on would just be overfitting.
- **Wash-sale rule** now applies to every taxable account (symbol level, both directions, disallowed loss moves into
  the replacement's cost basis; holding period is not tacked on). Previously a loss sold and rebought the next day
  counted in full, which flattered the engine's tax number. Curves are unchanged; only tax figures move.
- **`tax_status`: "taxable" | "sheltered"** on every account. Sheltered (IRA / 401k / Roth-style): no tax on realised
  gains, no wash-sale rule. Kept as separate ledgers: `ctl_engine_ira` (same trades as `ctl_engine`) and
  `ctl_placebo_ira` (same placebo draw via `seed`), so the same strategy can be compared in each wrapper. Realised
  vs unrealised gains stay split (short-/long-term) in both.
- UI: Admin -> Strategy -> Capital & tax and the user Track record page have a Taxable | Tax-sheltered toggle. The
  taxable view adds "Held back" (sells deferred by the lock) and "Wash-sale loss" columns and a tax-aware-vs-engine
  comparison; the sheltered view shows pre-tax results and costs and where the active strategy should live.
- After deploy: `run_paper_cycle --rebuild` (dry) then `--rebuild --apply` refreshes tax figures for existing
  accounts (curves must match to the cent); the next cycle creates the three new accounts by replaying history.
- Not modelled: tax-loss harvesting on purpose, loss carry-forward, state tax, qualified-dividend treatment,
  holding-period tacking on wash sales. All rates are placeholders until a CPA confirms them.

### Correction: "after tax" must include gains not yet realised (2026-09-21)

The first after-tax figure taxed only REALISED gains, so buy-and-hold (never sells) looked tax-free and a strategy that
defers gains looked better than it is. `after_tax_liquidated_return` ("if sold today") also taxes the gains still in open
lots, netted against realised ones; both are shown on Capital & tax, and the user-facing figure is the liquidated one.

Real backtest, taxable account, in-sample, parameters fixed in advance (assumed 32% short / 15% long-term rates):

| Strategy | Pre-tax | After realised tax | If sold today |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plain engine | +133.3% | +100.9% | +95.6% |
| **Tax-aware engine** | +126.6% | +117.4% | **+107.5%** |
| Placebo | +123.9% | +91.5% | +87.1% |
| SPY buy & hold | +119.6% | +119.6% | +101.7% |
| Equal-weight hold (15 symbols) | +213.3% | +213.3% | +181.3% |
| Engine in a sheltered account | +133.3% | +133.3% | +133.3% |
| Placebo in a sheltered account | +123.9% | +123.9% | +123.9% |

Read carefully: the tax-aware engine cut turnover 6.9x -> 1.3x a year (1,716 -> 194 trades, average hold 119 -> 490 days)
and keeps ~12 points more than the plain engine after tax; the plain engine LOSES to SPY after tax. The active edge is worth
most in a sheltered account. All in-sample: the engine's edge over the placebo (+9 pts pre-tax) and the tax-aware engine's
margin over SPY (+6 pts) may not survive out-of-sample; live paper days (from 2026-09-19) are the real test. Equal-weight is
not a fair market proxy: the 15 symbols were chosen with hindsight.

## Trend filter and volatility-targeted sizing (2026-09-21)

Two more reference strategies, specified in advance from their standard textbook forms and NOT tuned to the backtest
(constants in `app/paper.py`: `TREND_WINDOW=200`, `VOL_TARGET=15%`, `VOL_WINDOW=60`, `VOL_STEP=10%`). Neither uses the
engine's BUY/SELL signals. Each exists in a taxable account and a sheltered twin (same trades, different tax):
`ctl_trend` / `ctl_trend_ira`, `ctl_voltarget` / `ctl_voltarget_ira` (35 accounts in total).

- **`trend_filter`**: a symbol is held at its strategic weight only while its close at the END OF THE PREVIOUS MONTH was
  above its 200-day average, otherwise that slice is cash. The state is constant within a month and flips only on a
  month's first bar, so it uses only past data and trades rarely. With under 200 bars of history it stays invested.
- **`vol_target`**: the strategic basket is fully invested while its trailing 60-day volatility is at or below 15%, and
  scaled by 15%/volatility above that, in 10% steps (so it trades only on a real regime change). Never above 100%.
- Tested for: no lookahead (identical past + garbage future gives identical targets), month-constant trend state, no
  leverage, hand-checked basket volatility, sheltered twins trading identically, and verified rebuild.
- UI: wash-sale column relabelled "Wash-sale deferrals" (a cumulative count of losses deferred into cost basis; the same
  loss can be deferred repeatedly, so it can exceed the account size); chart palette widened to 10 hues; in the sheltered
  view active strategies list before the passive yardsticks.

## Research loop: associations, evidence gate, weekly digest; committee reviews all 15 (2026-09-21)

**Committee scope.** The daily committee now reviews ALL tracked symbols (`COMMITTEE_MIN_SYMBOLS=15`,
`COMMITTEE_MAX_SYMBOLS=15`, `COMMITTEE_DAILY_BUDGET_S=2400` in the VM `.env`; previous env saved as
`~/env-backup-pre-all15.txt`). That is ~105 model calls and 20+ minutes a day: watch free-tier quota and the
`answered x/10` column; a low-quorum review is flagged and not acted on. The paper cycle (22:45) waits for a review still running.

**Why not a self-modifying agent.** The tempting design (agents rewriting their own prompts, weights or strategies daily
from what they just saw) fits noise: a few reviews a day and a few weeks of live data cannot tell skill from luck, and 15 stocks
give hundreds of relationships to "discover". So the loop is split and gated:
- **Daily** (`app/associations.py`): correlations, clusters (groups that are really one bet), market cohesion vs its own
  history, and a lead-lag scan -- recomputed from prices, no storage. Every committee prompt now carries a peer line (who the stock
  moves with, what those peers signal, whether the market is moving as one). Lead-lag uses a permutation max-statistic bar
  (shuffle each series independently, keep the largest chance correlation across ALL pairs and lags, require the real one to beat
  the 95th percentile). An earlier Bonferroni/bell-curve version reported a false discovery in pure noise (fat tails and
  volatility clustering); the replacement has a regression test on such noise. "Crowded" cohesion additionally needs avg corr >= 0.30.
- **Weekly** (`app/research.py`, `python -m app.scripts.run_weekly_research`, cron `30 23 * * 5`): a digest in Admin -> Reports
  (also Admin -> Strategy -> Research): what was analysed, live results vs yardsticks, association changes, agent status, proposals.
- **Gate**: a strategy counts as an improvement only with >= 60 LIVE trading days and a bootstrap CI of its daily excess return
  over the yardstick (equal-weight hold; the placebo) above zero after correcting for the number of comparisons. Until then the
  verdict is "insufficient" -- expected for weeks. Agent re-weighting is proposed only for agents with >= 30 scored BUY/SELL calls,
  shrunk toward equal weight (+1% edge -> +25%, capped at +/-50%).
- **Human in the loop**: proposals are text. There is deliberately no code path that edits an agent, prompt, weight or strategy
  (a test asserts this). Closing the loop later means an admin-approved change, applied one at a time, with the gate as evidence.

## Data integrity: an 8-month hole in the price history (found 2026-09-21)

The new association analytics exposed it: a lead-lag bar of |r| >= 0.90 and "+28% JNJ / -25% TSLA / +11% SPY" on a single day
(2026-08-20). Cause: the daily sync fetched `history(period="10d")` and merged it onto the stored file. On its first VM run the
file ended 2025-12-29, so only the last 10 days were appended and Jan-Aug 2026 (234 calendar days) was never backfilled; the
whole hole became ONE "daily" return that hit all 15 symbols at once. It corrupted volatility, risk scores, correlations, the
volatility-targeted strategy's sizing and the paper accounts' history across that date.
- Fix: the updater now fetches from 7 days before the LAST STORED bar OR before the EARLIEST hole in the file, whichever is earlier (a first version only looked at the last bar and did NOT heal a hole in the middle: caught by verifying on prod), and warns loudly if
  a hole remains. `PriceBook.gaps()` finds holes (> 5 calendar days between bars); risk, correlations and basket volatility now
  treat a return across a hole as unknown (0) instead of a day; the Strategy page shows a red banner and the weekly digest a
  DATA QUALITY WARNING while any hole exists.
- Repair (prod): backup, backfill by running the sync once, then `run_paper_cycle --rebuild --apply --allow-differences`
  (the replayed accounts legitimately differ because the PRICES changed; old vs new totals are printed).
- Every backtest figure quoted before this repair spanned the hole and should be re-read from the rebuilt accounts.

### Repair carried out on prod (2026-09-21) and the CORRECTED results

Backups first (`~/data_parquet-backup-2026-09-21.tgz`, `~/paper-accounts-backup-pre-datafix.json`); the sync backfilled 160
missing bars per symbol (2,533 -> 2,693 dates, no gaps left); all 35 accounts were replayed from scratch on the corrected
prices (`--rebuild --apply --allow-differences`) and a second dry run matched 35/35. Residual: a one-time dividend-basis
step where the backfilled prices join the old ones at 2025-12-22 (up to -3.2% for TLT; mostly < 1.3%), because the old rows
were adjusted at an earlier date. Everything quoted in earlier sections was computed across the hole and is superseded by:

Backtest 2021-01 -> 2026-09-18, taxable "if sold today" (assumed 32% short / 15% long-term), in-sample, params fixed in advance:

| Strategy | Pre-tax | If sold today | Worst drop | Sharpe |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Volatility-targeted | +143.9% | +117.4% | -23.8% | 1.12 |
| Tax-aware engine | +130.1% | +109.5% | -27.3% | 1.03 |
| SPY buy & hold | +119.6% | +101.7% | -24.5% | 0.91 |
| Plain engine | +141.2% | +97.5% | -26.0% | 1.06 |
| Trend filter (200-day) | +115.6% | +94.3% | -13.7% | 1.17 |
| Placebo | +128.3% | +89.1% | -27.2% | 1.01 |
| Equal-weight hold (15 stocks) | +213.3% | +181.3% | -34.2% | 1.01 |

What changed vs the pre-repair numbers: the trend filter was flattered (it had +135% / +112% / Sharpe 1.40 by acting on stale
trend states across the hole) and now trails SPY after tax, though its drawdown is still about half of SPY's; the engine's
edge over the placebo is +12.9 pts pre-tax (was +9.4); the tax-aware engine still beats the plain engine after tax by ~12 pts
and beats SPY; volatility targeting is the best risk-managed result and barely moved. Sheltered (pre-tax): vol-target +143.9%,
engine +141.2%, placebo +128.3%, trend +115.6%. Equal-weight hold remains the highest, on a universe chosen with hindsight.

Analytics after the repair: only IWM/QQQ/SPY form a "one bet" cluster (QQQ-SPY 0.89); no lead-lag relationship survives. The
lead-lag scan now ranks returns (Spearman) before the shuffle test because single-day jumps (earnings moves) inflated the
plain-correlation bar to ~0.8 and blinded it; plain-noise datasets flag at about the 5% level by design (tested as a rate).

**Lead-lag null, second correction (2026-09-21).** Instrumenting the scan on real data showed the shuffle null was still wrong:
shifting each stock independently sometimes aligned two stocks that are ~0.9 correlated on the SAME day (SPY/QQQ) and that
same-day link posed as a lag, so the null maximum hit 0.93 and the bar sat at ~0.8 (the data's own maximum was 0.22, in line with
independent noise 0.21). The null now shuffles whole DAYS jointly across every stock (same-day structure kept, lags destroyed) on
rank-transformed returns; regression tests cover both the jump case and the correlated-pair case, and plain noise is tested as a
false-positive RATE, not a lucky seed.

## Free public data + the arena (2026-09-21)

**Free data, all commercially usable** (`app/free_data.py`, refreshed by `python -m app.scripts.refresh_free_data`, cron `5 22 * * 1-5`,
i.e. after the price sync and BEFORE the committee): SEC EDGAR company fundamentals (XBRL, latest FULL fiscal year: revenue growth, margins,
ROE, leverage, free-cash-flow margin, P/E) and the filing feed (8-K events in plain English, 10-K/10-Q dates); US Treasury yield curve and
BLS unemployment / CPI. Read-only cache under `TRADING_STORAGE_PATH/free_data`; the committee and UI never touch the network. Everything is
point-in-time (only what had been FILED by the date; a later restatement never leaks backward; BLS months only after their release (12 days for unemployment, 20 for CPI)).
Committee prompts now carry fundamentals, recent filings and the macro backdrop; the user's stance raises a flagged filing (CEO change,
impairment, restructuring, delisting notice, auditor change ...) as a reason to look, and shows the macro line and a fundamentals glance.
SEC needs `SEC_USER_AGENT` = a project name plus a monitored email (the SEC's fair-access policy; at most 10 requests/second): without it
the SEC part is OFF and says so, while Treasury/BLS still work. Funds have no company filings by design.

**Arena** (`app/arena.py`, `docs/ARENA.md`): any outside decision-maker (TradingAgents, a human, a future variant) records daily BUY/SELL/HOLD
calls; a paper account trades exactly on them and is judged by the same live evidence gate as our own strategies. Neutral where silent
(never our engine), stored apart from our committee decisions, never shown to users.
