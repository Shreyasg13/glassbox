/**
 * The single dedicated conversion moment between the Lens carousel and
 * the rest of the marketing page -- per the Plan-correction.MD addendum
 * ("final conversion section"). Deliberately does NOT claim a specific
 * free-signal quota (e.g. "5 free verified signals"): the addendum's own
 * rule is that a quantified free-tier claim must be backed by real,
 * backend-enforced entitlements before it's shown anywhere, and that
 * enforcement doesn't exist yet. This uses one of the addendum's own
 * listed safe alternative headlines instead, which makes the same
 * "verify, don't trust" pitch without inventing a number.
